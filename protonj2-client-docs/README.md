# Qpid protonj2 client documentation

The protonj2 client is a feature rich AMQP v1.0 client implementing an imperative API that offers users full access to the AMQP protocol while attempting to be easy to use even if you are just getting started with AMQP or Messaging.

The documentation is split up into various section to make finding help easier, if you are new then it is recommended that you read the getting started guide first to get a basic overview of the client API.

If you are viewing this documentation from an archive the most current versions can be found in the project [source repository](https://github.com/apache/qpid-protonj2).
